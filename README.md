## Password Generator

This is a simple password generator built with React. It allows users to generate random passwords of a specified length, with options to include numbers and special characters.

### Getting Started

To run the project, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed. Once you have these installed, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/karanbarman/password-generator
cd password-generator
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running the following command:

```
npm start
```

The development server will start on port 3000. You can access the password generator by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### How to Use

The password generator is very simple to use. Here are the steps on how to use it:

1. **Specify the password length.** You can specify the length of the password by using the range slider. The minimum length is 8 characters and the maximum length is 100 characters.
2. **Select whether to include numbers.** You can choose to include numbers in the password by checking the "Numbers" checkbox.
3. **Select whether to include special characters.** You can choose to include special characters in the password by checking the "Characters" checkbox.
4. **Generate the password.** Once you have specified the password length and options, you can generate the password by clicking the "Generate" button.
5. **Copy the password to the clipboard.** You can copy the generated password to the clipboard by clicking the "Copy" button.

### Code Explanation

The password generator is built using React. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Import the necessary modules.** The first few lines of the code import the necessary modules from the React library.
2. **Define the functional component.** The `Home` function is the functional component that represents the password generator.
3. **Define the state variables.** The `Home` component defines several state variables:
   _ `length`: This state variable stores the length of the password.
   _ `numberAllowed`: This state variable stores whether numbers are allowed in the password.
   _ `characterAllowed`: This state variable stores whether special characters are allowed in the password.
   _ `password`: This state variable stores the generated password.
